# A Numerical Solution to the Blasius Similarity Equation

This solution considers the Blasius Boundary Layer Solution for flow over a flat plate of length unity.
The similarity variables are given by

$$\eta = y \sqrt{U\over xv}$$
$$f'(\eta) = {u\over U}$$
$$\sqrt{U\nu\over x}{(nf' - f)}$$

$U$ denotes the freestream velocity.
The Blasius similarity equation is given by:
$$ ff'' + f''' = 0$$
The Boundary conditions are given as:

$$f(0) = 0$$
$$f'(0) = 0$$
$$f'(\infty) = 1$$
